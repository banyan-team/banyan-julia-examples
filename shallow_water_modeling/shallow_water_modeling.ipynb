    "# Shallow Water Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to run an MPI implementation of the shallow water model on a Banyan computing session with a number of workers running in parallel. Banyan automatically sets up cloud computing resources in your own Virtual Private Cloud, sets up MPI and Julia, manages your software environment, lets you run with any number of workers, and scales down when you're finished. All your estimated costs, running clusters, sessions, and logs can be viewed on the [Banyan dashboard](https://www.banyancomputing.com/dashboard).\n",
